express_imgur_portfolio
=======================

Use imgur as a content manager for a portfolio site. 

I often upload my projects as imgur albums to share them on reddit. This is a node.js and express app 
that parses my imgur albums page and makes a quick portfolio site out of it. 

Not sure where this is in terms of imgur terms of use, but it lets me use them as a really nice content management
service and allows me to display the albums on a sweet looking portfolio app
